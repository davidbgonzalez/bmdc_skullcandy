Purpose
----------
This app serves two purposes. First we need users to authenticate with the twitter oauth api so that we can use their credentials to download additional data. This method was used to collect over 20GB of tweets from the Skullcandy followers and the followers of similar brands.

Second, this app is a proof of concept for building more engaging marketing campaigns that both collect greater insights about the intended demographic and also provide greater incentives to individuals.
